Objective:
To practice file handling operations in Python by creating, reading, and processing student data from files, and generating an analysis based on specific conditions.
Instructions:
•	Create a Python script that performs the following tasks.
•	Use comments to explain each part of your code.
•	Ensure your code is well-organized and follows best practices.
1. Assignment Tasks:
•	Create a File with Student Data:
•	Write a Python function create_result_file(file_path) that creates a file named result.txt.
•	The file should contain the following data for 30 students: name, register number, grades for five subjects, total marks, and percentage.
•	Use the given grade points to calculate the total and percentage:
'O' - 10 points
'A' - 9 points
'B' - 8 points
'C' - 7 points
'D' - below 6 points
'U' - 0 points (Arrear)
2. Read and Display File Content:
Write a function read_result_file(file_path) that reads and prints the content of result.txt.
3. Analyze Student Data:
•	Write a function analyze_results(input_file, output_file) that reads data from result.txt and writes the analysis to analysis.txt.
•	The analysis should categorize students based on their percentage into the following groups:
I.	Students who score 90% and above
II.	Students who score equal to or above 80% and below 90%
III.	Students who score equal to or above 70% and below 80%
IV.	Students who score below 70%
V.	Students having arrear
